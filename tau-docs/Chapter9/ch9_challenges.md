# Challenges

Our Element class can now have any functionality we want! This is a very powerful way for you to control what you can and cannot do with your elements. Let's add a "hover" method to the Element class.

The challenge is to add a Hover() method so that each element can then simply call .Hover()

Example: `Pages.Home.Headernav.CardsLink.Hover()`

> HINT: The Actions class is in `OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions`
