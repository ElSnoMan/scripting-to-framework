# Intro
Hi, my name is Carlos Kidman and welcome to my course:
"From Scripting to Framework with Selenium and C#"

I specialize in Test Automation and Infrastructure, but I'm officially a QA Manager and Lead or Sr. Automation Engineer aka Software Engineer in Test. I'm also the Founder of QA at the Point and do quite a bit in and out of work. Feel free to give me a follow and hit me up on Twitter or Slack or LinkedIn. Honestly, I'd love to chat :)

In this course, we'll be talking about what a Test Automation Framework is and looks like, but we'll also be designing and implementing one from scratch. The goal of this course is to get you to understand the concepts of a Framework by showing you real, concrete examples. What you will learn is that there is so much more to Test Automation than just scripting some tests and running them. This will be a great start to build enterprise-level solutions to Test Automation and show you what you can do to make your tests easy to read, write, and maintain.

Topics that we'll be covering include:

[] Programming with C#. I won't dive into many details, but that's the language we're using.
[] Refactoring
[] Page Object Model and other Patterns
[] JSON and Configurations
[] Leveraging test data
[] Working with HTTP endpoints
[] Simple logging and reporting
[] NUnit Testing Framework
[] Test Structure

There will be a lot of coding, so I hope you're as excited as I am to get started! I want to start the course off right with a quote that I think is helpful for people learning and starting out:

"Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie

I can promise you that none of us starting out knowing everything. We had to spend time practicing, reading, researching, trying and failing, until we were able to figure things out. That's why resources like Test Automation University are so valuable. We want to make your journey a lot more fun with a lot more direction. Just keep practicing and believing in yourself and you'll reap what you sow.

With that out of the way, and goodness a little tear came to my eye, let's dive into Chapter 1: Machine Setup.
