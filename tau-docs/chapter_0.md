# Intro
Hi, my name is Carlos Kidman and welcome to my course:
"From Scripting to Framework with Selenium and C#"

In this course, we'll be talking about what a Test Automation Framework is and looks like,
but we'll also be designing and implementing one from scratch. The goal of this course is
to get you understand and build enterprise-level solutions to test automation and what you can do
to make your tests easy to read, write, and maintain.

Topics that we'll be covering include:

[] Basic programming with C#
[] Refactoring
[] JSON and Configurations
[] Page Object Model and other Patterns
[] Leveraging test data
[] Working with HTTP endpoints
[] Simple logging and reporting
[] NUnit Testing Framework
[] Test Structure

There will be a lot of coding, so I hope you're as excited as I am to get started! Let's go!
