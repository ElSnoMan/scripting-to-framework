# Challenges

## Challenge 1
On the CardDetailsPage, I skipped ahead to save on time. If you paused the video to copy what I had down in my CardDetailsPageMap, you may have noticed that Test 2 fails on the rarity assertion with a message like:

> Expected string length 6 but was 13.
> Expected: "Common"
> But was: "Rarity\nCommon"

The challenge is for you to solve the failure so the tests pass.
Extra points if you can do it without touching any code in the test.


## Challenge 2
If you are getting an error that looks like this:

> No such element found with css "a[href='Ice Spirit']"

Then this challenge is for you! The challenge is to fix this issue. Easy as that.

> HINT:
`cardName.Replace()` does not change the string value "in place".
