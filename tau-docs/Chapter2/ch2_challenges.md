# Challenge

If you are on a Windows machine, your tests are most likely failing because of the browser window size.

If the webpage isn't big enough for statsroyale.com, the header navigation links are wrapped into a hamburger menu which causes the initial "/cards" link to not be found.

The challenge is to open the browser in a maximized state to solve that error.

> HINT:
* There are a few ways to accomplish this. Use the one that works for you.
* If you are on a Mac or Linux machine, you may need to find a more unique way to do this, but it's not mandatory.

Good luck!
