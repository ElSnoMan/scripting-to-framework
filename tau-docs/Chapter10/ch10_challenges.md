# Challenges

I bet you already have some ideas for things we could put into our framework-config.json.

For this challenge, add a "waitSeconds" property to hold the default number of seconds that we want to use when instantiating our Wait class.

> HINT:
* We're instantiating Wait in Driver.Init()
* Instead of using the magic, hard-coded number of `10`, put that into our config JSON and then use the value in code
