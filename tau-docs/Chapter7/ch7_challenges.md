# Challenges

## CHALLENGE 7a
If you followed me along and copied exactly the code I wrote, then your tests should be failing! You can't always believe what the devs tell you because they can make mistakes too!

The challenge is, if you haven't already, fix the errors so the User_can_copy_the_deck test passes.

> HINT: I copied and pasted my locators when I refactored the scripted test into their respective pages. They might be wrong! Oh no!


## CHALLENGE 7b
I'm sure things on the website have changed since this recording so I'd be surprised if the CopyDeckTests were passing for you! I hope they are! However, if they are not, the challenge is to solve the errors so they all pass consistently.

> HINT: You may want to look at the Title value on the web page's HTML.
